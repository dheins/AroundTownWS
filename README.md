# AroundTownWS
 
 SOAP based web service that allows users to define the best and worst parts of their town!  
 This service allows users to create a new entry, delete entries that they have created, and
 get a list of all the entries.  The goal of this project was to gain experience creating
 a SOAP based web service using Apache CXF and JAX-WS that is connected to a database and 
 employs various levels of security including user authentication,message encryption, message 
 signature, and adding a time stamp to the message.
